#Lab4's Assignment - Notes

##Compulsory

* [X]Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have at least the following classes: Student, School and the main class.

* [X]Create all the objects in the example using streams.

* [X]Create a list of students, using LinkedList implementation. Sort the students, using a comparator.

* [X]Create a set of schools, using a TreeSet implementation. Make sure that School objects are comparable.

* [X]Create two maps (having different implementations) describing the students and the school preferences and print them on the screen.

After execution, the program displays the following output:
```
School(name=H1, capacity=1)
Student(name=S0)
Student(name=S1)
Student(name=S2)
Student(name=S3)
Students map: 
Student(name=S0)=[School(name=H1, capacity=1), School(name=H1, capacity=2), School(name=H1, capacity=2)]
Student(name=S1)=[School(name=H1, capacity=1), School(name=H1, capacity=2), School(name=H1, capacity=2)]
Student(name=S2)=[School(name=H1, capacity=1), School(name=H1, capacity=2)]
Student(name=S3)=[School(name=H1, capacity=2), School(name=H1, capacity=2)]
Schools map: 
School(name=H1, capacity=1)=[Student(name=S0), Student(name=S1), Student(name=S3)]
